# Gimli Dashboard Frontend

## Description 

This is just a basic front-end for my [discord bot](https://github.com/Dulinniel/Gimli-bot) dashboard... well right now it's not really pretty, but I can assure you, it will be good looking one day

## Usage

Well, that's a svelte project, so you need to [install nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

If you already did, clone the repo and get into it

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Dulinniel/Gimli_dashboard-frontend.git
cd Gimli_dashboard-frontend
```

Then install the packages using npm or wathever you use

```sh
npm i
```

And you can run it using

```sh
npm run dev
```

You should be able to access-it at : `http://localhost:5173`. But remember, without it [backend](https://github.com/Dulinniel/Gimli_Dashboard-backend), it's just a muon.
